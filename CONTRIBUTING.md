## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [American Express Open Source Code of Conduct](https://github.com/americanexpress/code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the repository maintainers.

---

## Project Overview

**jpa-lite** is a lightweight Java Persistence API (JPA) implementation designed for high-throughput and batch processing scenarios. It provides a developer-friendly abstraction over JDBC that significantly reduces boilerplate code while maintaining a minimal memory footprint — making it suitable for enterprise-grade batch workloads where traditional JPA implementations like Hibernate or EclipseLink introduce excessive memory overhead and garbage collection pressure.

Key capabilities:
- Lightweight CRUD operations via annotated JPA entities (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`, etc.).
- Dependency injection support via `@Dao` and `@PersistenceContext` annotations.
- Named Native Query support for complex SQL execution.
- Fluent Criteria Query API for building dynamic queries without a `CriteriaBuilder`.
- Batch insert support with automatic transaction management.
- DDL schema generation via the `schema-gen` command-line tool.
- Compatible with any Java tech stack: Jakarta EE, Spring Boot, Vert.x, and more.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub Enterprise.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jpa-lite.git
   cd jpa-lite
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sudiptasish/jpa-lite.git
   ```

---

## Development Setup

This project uses **Maven** as its build tool. Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.8+

Build the project:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

To skip tests during the build:

```bash
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

To run tests only:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

> **Note:** Ensure the `javax.persistence-api` and `slf4j-api` JARs are available in your local Maven repository or via the configured `settings.xml`.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sudiptasish/jpa-lite/issues) and include:

- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Java version and OS details.
- Any relevant logs or stack traces.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for new features or improvements. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/sudiptasish/jpa-lite/issues) with:

- A clear description of the enhancement.
- The motivation and use case behind the request.
- Any alternative solutions you have considered.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Sync** your fork with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
2. **Create a feature branch** off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes**, following the [coding standards](#coding-standards).
4. **Write or update tests** to cover your changes.
5. **Run the full test suite** to ensure nothing is broken (see [Testing](#testing)).
6. **Commit** your changes with a clear message (see [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)).
7. **Push** your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
8. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

## Coding Standards

- Follow standard **Java coding conventions** (Oracle Java Code Conventions).
- Use meaningful class, method, and variable names.
- Keep methods focused and concise — prefer single-responsibility design.
- Add Javadoc comments to all public classes and methods.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary external dependencies without prior discussion.
- When adding new Criteria operations, ensure bind parameter handling is consistent with the existing `Criteria` API.
- Do not use Hibernate or EclipseLink internals — jpa-lite is an independent implementation.

---

## Testing

All contributions must include appropriate tests. The project uses **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**.

```bash
# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run a specific test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=YourTestClass
```

- Aim for high test coverage on new code.
- Ensure all existing tests continue to pass.
- Tests are located under `src/test/java/`.
- Performance-sensitive code paths should include benchmarking notes in the PR description.

---

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` if your change affects public-facing behavior, configuration, or API usage.
- Add or update Javadoc for any modified or new public APIs.
- If adding new query types or Criteria operations, include usage examples in the README under the appropriate section.
- If schema generation behaviour changes, update the [Schema Generation](README.md#schema-generation) section accordingly.

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` – A new feature
- `fix` – A bug fix
- `docs` – Documentation changes only
- `test` – Adding or updating tests
- `refactor` – Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `chore` – Build process or tooling changes
- `ci` – CI/CD pipeline changes
- `perf` – A code change that improves performance

**Example:**
```
feat(criteria): add support for IS NULL predicate in Criteria query

Adds `.isNull()` predicate to the Criteria fluent API, enabling queries
like `.where("column").isNull()` to be expressed without raw SQL.

Closes #42
```

## Review Process

- All pull requests require at least **one approval** from a [code owner](CODEOWNERS) before merging.
- CI checks (build, tests, Jacoco coverage) must pass before a PR can be merged.
- Feedback will be provided within a reasonable timeframe.
- Please be responsive to review comments and update your PR accordingly.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion or reach out to the maintainers listed in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).
